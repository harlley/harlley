# Harlley Oliveira - Senior Full-Stack Engineer

I'm a Senior Software Engineer passionate about building high-performance, user-centric web applications. With extensive experience in React, TypeScript, Next.js, and design systems, I specialize in crafting scalable UI architectures that enhance usability, maintainability, and developer experience.

Over the years, I've worked on everything from design systems to complex integrations, leading front-end initiatives at startups and high-growth companies. At Issuu, I played a key role in developing seamless integrations with platforms like Canva, Adobe, and HubSpot, helping drive both user engagement and revenue. Prior to that, I founded my own startup, which gave me a deep appreciation for product thinking, user experience, and the intersection of engineering and business strategy.

I thrive in environments where engineers have ownership and contribute beyond just writing code—collaborating closely with designers, refining UX, and ensuring performance at scale. Always eager to learn and share knowledge, I'm open to connecting and collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of software development.
