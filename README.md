I started my career in 2002 as an Intern, developing new features on a web application using HTML, CSS, Javascript, ASP 3.0, and SQL Server for an IBM partner in Brazil. After that, I worked in a software house, developing many different web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, ASP.net, C#, SQL Server, and PHP for a big telecommunication company. 

I also worked for six years in the biggest governmental software company in Latin America, developing several graphical interfaces for web sites and web applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.
